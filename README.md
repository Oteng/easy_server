# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a **JavaScript/TypeScript-based web application** built using Express.js framework with supplementary dependencies to enhance functionality, such as authentication, API documentation, and performance security.

### Key Features
- **Web server:** Leverages Express.js for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implements secure user authentication using `jsonwebtoken` and password hashing through `bcrypt`.
- **API Documentation:** Fully documented API using `swagger-ui-express` for Swagger-based documentation.
- **Middleware Integration:**
    - **Helmet:** Enhances security by setting various HTTP headers.
    - **CORS:** Allows cross-origin resource sharing for APIs.
    - **Multer:** Handles file uploads in forms.
- **Development and Unit Testing Tools:**
    - `Nodemon` to facilitate automatic server restarts during development.
    - `Supertest` for writing integration tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (>= Version 22.x recommended)
- **npm** (latest version)

### Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
    - Create an `.env` file in the root of the project.
    - Add the required environment variables (e.g., `PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`, database configurations, etc.) based on the template provided below:

```
PORT=3000
     JWT_SECRET=<your_secret_here>
     DB_HOST=<database_host>
```

4. Start the server in development mode:
```shell script
npm run dev
```

5. For production mode:
```shell script
npm start
```

## Key Scripts
The following npm scripts are available in the `"scripts"` section of `package.json`:

- **Start server in development mode:**
```shell script
npm run dev
```
Runs the server with `nodemon` for live reloading.

- **Start server in production mode:**
```shell script
npm start
```

- **Run tests:**
```shell script
npm test
```
Executes test cases using libraries like `Supertest`.

- **Lint the project:**
```shell script
npm run lint
```
Lints the codebase using ESLint and the `eslint-config-standard` configuration.
